 *   - A FaÃ§ade API for the configuration, setup, and execution of distributed systems
 *   - A corpus of settings and defaults for distributed aggregate systems
 *   - Some general, utility members (string representations for types such as ID, LSNS,..),
 *     used for example in the command-line parser.
